# DevLog

- 29/9:  The first update is a bit late but Now, I plan on doing the devlog for this repo daily
  - update 1: Added the theme-switcher and it was easier to implement than what I expected, Looking forward to adding more content to the website.
  - update 2: I should probably resume work on making the porjects section of the page but my internet connection won't allow me to. BSNL must be angry that we plan to switch from them to another ISP that they just decided to slow our network speeds and not provide internet at all otherwise.
